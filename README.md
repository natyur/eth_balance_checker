Ethereum Balance Checker

1) Set Up a Tunnel for index.html.
MetaMask does not work with local file:// addresses, so you need to use a local server:
	- Run a simple Python server: python -m http.server 8000
	- Alternatively, use services like Serveo or similar
2) Set Up MetaMask and Connect Your Wallet.
To use the application, make sure MetaMask is installed and connected to the Ethereum network:
	- Install MetaMask in your browser
	- Create an Ethereum account in MetaMask
	- Click the "Connect MetaMask" button on the page
3) Check Balances. Enter a valid Ethereum address (e.g., from etherscan.io) into the input field on the page and click the button to check balances. You will be able to see the ETH and USDT balances for the specified address.
